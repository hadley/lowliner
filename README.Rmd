## Overview

purrr enhances R's functional programming (FP) toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors. If you've never heard of FP before, the best place to start is the family of `map()` functions which allow you to replace many for loops with code that is both more succinct and easier to read. The best place to learn about the `map()` functions is the [iteration chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html) in R for data science.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# The easiest way to get purrr is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just purrr:
install.packages("purrr")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/purrr")
```

## Usage

The following example uses purrr to solve a fairly realistic problem: split a data frame into pieces, fit a model to each piece, compute the summary, then extract the R^2^.

```{r}
library(purrr)

mtcars %>%
  split(.$cyl) %>% # from base R
  map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map_dbl("r.squared")
```

This example illustrates some of the advantages of purrr functions over the equivalents in base R:

* The first argument is always the data, so purrr works naturally with the pipe.

* All purrr functions are type-stable. They always return the advertised output
  type (`map()` returns lists; `map_dbl()` returns double vectors), or they 
  throw an errror.
  
* All `map()` functions either accept function, formulas (used for succinctly
  generating anonymous functions), a character vector (used to extract 
  components by name), or a numeric vector (used to extract by position).
