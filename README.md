# purrr

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hadley/purrr.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hadley/purrr)

Purrr makes your pure functions purr by completing R's functional programming tools with important features from other languages, in the style of the JS packages [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org), [lodash](https://lodash.com) and [lazy.js](http://danieltao.com/lazy.js/).

## Installation

purrr is currently not on CRAN, but you can get it from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hadley/purrr")
```

## Examples

The following example uses purrr to solve a fairly realistic problem: split a data frame into pieces, fit a model to each piece, summarise and extract R^2.

```R
library(purrr)

mtcars %>%
  split(.$cyl) %>%
  map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)) %>%
  map(summary) %>%
  map_v("r.squared")
```

Note the three types of input to `map()`: a function, a formula (converted to an anonymous function), or a string (used to extract named components).

The following more complicated example shows how you might generate 100 random test-training splits, fit a model to each training split then evaluate based on the test split:

```R
library(dplyr)
random_group <- function(n, probs) {
  probs <- probs / sum(probs)
  g <- findInterval(seq(0, 1, length = n), c(0, cumsum(probs)),
    rightmost.closed = TRUE)
  names(probs)[sample(g)]
}
partition <- function(df, n, probs) {
  replicate(n, split(df, random_group(nrow(df), probs)), FALSE) %>%
    unzip() %>%
    as_data_frame()
}

msd <- function(x, y) sqrt(mean((x - y) ^ 2))

# Genearte 100 rbootandom test-training splits
boot <- partition(mtcars, 100, c(test = 0.8, training = 0.2))
boot

boot <- boot %>% mutate(
  # Fit the models
  models = map(training, ~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)),
  # Make predictions on test data
  preds = map2(models, test, predict),
  diffs = map2(preds, test %>% map("mpg"), msd)
)

# Evaluate mean-squared difference between predicted and actual
mean(unlist(boot$diffs))
```

## API

### Transformation

* Apply a function to each element: `map()` returns transformed list;
  `map_v()` returns transformed vector, `walk()` returns original list, calling
  function for its side effects; `map2()` and `map3()` vectorise over multiple
  inputs.

* Reduce a list to a single value by iteratively applying a binary
  function: `reduce()` and `reduce_right()`.

* Figure out if a list contains an object: `contains()`.

* Order, sort and split a list based on its components with `split_by()`,
  `order_by()` and `sort_by()`.

### Predicate functions

(A predicate function is a function that either returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`)

* `keep()` or `discard()` elements that satisfy the predicate..

* Does `every()` element or `some()` elements satisfy the predicate?

* Find the value (`detect()`) and index (`detect_index()`) of the first element
  that satisfies the predicate.

* Find the head/tail that satisfies a predicate: `head_while()`, `tail_while()`.

### Lists of functions

* `invoke()` every function in a list with given arguments and returns
  a list, `invoke_v()` returns a vector.

### Function operators

* Fill in function arguments with `partial()`.

* Convert a function to take a list of inputs with `smash()`.

* Compose multiple functions into a single function with `compose()`.

* Negate a predicate funtion with `negate()`.

## Philosophy

The goal is not to try and simulate Haskell in R: purrr does not implement currying or destructuring binds or pattern matching. The goal is to give you similar expressiveness to an FP language, while allowing you to write code that looks and works like R.

* Instead of point free style, use the pipe, `%>%`, to write code that can be
  read from left to right.

* Instead of currying, we use `...` to pass in extra arguments.

* Anonymous functions are verbose in R, so we provide two convenient shorthands.
  For predicate functions, `~ . + 1` is equivalent to `function(.) . + 1`.
  For chains of transformations functions, `. %>% f() %>% g()` is
  equivalent to `function(.) . %>% f() %>% g()`.

* R is weakly typed, so we can implement general `zip()` and `unzip()`,
  rather than having to specialise on the number of arguments. (That said
  I still provide `map2()` and `map3()` since it's useful to clearly separate
  which arguments are vectorised over).

* R has named arguments, so instead of providing different functions for
  minor variations (e.g. `detect()` and `detectLast()`) I use a named
  argument, `.first`. Type-stable functions are easy to reason about so
  additional arguments will never change the type of the output.
