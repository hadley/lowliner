\title{Convert an object into a function.}
\usage{
as_function(.f, ...)

\method{as_function}{character}(.f, ..., .null = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{.f}{A function, formula, or atomic vector.

  If a \strong{function}, it is used as is.

  If a \strong{formula}, e.g. \code{~ .x + 2}, it is converted to a function
  with one or two arguments, \code{.x} or \code{.x} and \code{.y},
  respectively. This allows you to create very compact anonymous functions
  with up to two inputs.

  If \strong{character} or \strong{integer vector}, it is converted to an
  extractor function, e.g. \code{"y"} becomes \code{function(x) x[["y"]]}. To
  index deeply into a nested list, use multiple values; \code{c("x", "y")} is
  equivalent to \code{z[["x"]][["y"]]}. You can also use \code{.null} to
  provide a default to use instead of \code{NULL} for absent components.

  If a mixed \strong{list} of character and integer, it is also converted to
  a recursive extractor function, e.g. \code{list(i, "foo")} is equivalent
  to \code{z[[i]][["foo"]]}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to methods and fixed, common
arguments to \code{.f}.}

\item{.null}{Optional argument for extractor inputs, i.e. character, numeric,
or list. Used as default value when requested item does not exist or is
\code{NULL}.}
}
\description{
\code{as_function} is the powerhouse behind the varied function
specifications that purrr functions allow. This is an S3 generic so that
other people can make \code{as_function} work with their own objects.

\examples{
as_function(~ . + 1)
as_function(1)
as_function(c("a", "b", "c"))
as_function(c("a", "b", "c"), .null = NA)
