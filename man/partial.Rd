\title{Partial apply a function, filling in some arguments.}
\usage{
partial(...f, ..., .first = TRUE, .env, .lazy)
}
\arguments{
\item{...f}{a function.}

\item{...}{named arguments to \code{...f} that should be partially applied.
\link[rlang:UQ]{Unquoting and splicing} semantics are supported, see
\emph{Examples}.}

\item{.first}{If \code{TRUE}, the partialized arguments are placed
to the front of the function signature. If \code{FALSE}, they are
moved to the back. Only useful to control position matching of
arguments when the partialized arguments are not named.}

\item{.env, .lazy}{Obsolete. Partialized arguments are captured as
\link[rlang:quo]{quosures} (thus rendering the \code{.env} argument obsolete).
They are \link[rlang:eval_tidy]{tidily evaluated} each time the partial
application of \code{...f} is called. To fix the value of a partialized argument
in the context where \code{partial()} is called, unquote it with the
\code{\link[rlang:UQ]{!!}} operator. (Previously, lazy evaluation was
controlled by the \code{.lazy} flag.)}
}
\description{
Partial function application allows you to modify a function by pre-filling
some of the arguments.  It is particularly useful in conjunction with
functionals and other function operators.
}
\section{Design choices}{


There are many ways to implement partial function application in R.
(see e.g. \code{dots} in \url{https://github.com/crowding/ptools} for another
approach.)  This implementation is based on creating functions that are as
similar as possible to the anonymous functions that you'd create by hand,
if you weren't using \code{partial}.
}

\examples{
# Partial is designed to replace the use of anonymous functions for
# filling in function arguments. Instead of:
compact1 <- function(x) discard(x, is.null)

# we can write:
compact2 <- partial(discard, .p = is.null)

# When printed, the partialized arguments and original function are shown:
compact2

# Note that the evaluation occurs "lazily" so that arguments will be
# repeatedly evaluated
f <- partial(runif, n = rpois(1, 5))
f
f()
f()

# You can override this by unquoting:
f <- partial(runif, n = !! rpois(1, 5))
f
f()
f()

# Partialized arguments can be spliced:
args <- list(n = rpois(1, 5))
f <- partial(runif, !!! args)
f
f()
f()

# partial() works fine with functions that do non-standard evaluation
my_long_variable <- 1:10
plot2 <- partial(plot, my_long_variable)
plot2()
plot2(runif(10), type = "l")

}
